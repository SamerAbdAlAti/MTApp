<p>It is an application created with the flutter framework; It fetches movies and TV shows, advertises them, and evaluates them globally.
The application also allows searching for movies and TV shows, and the application works very efficiently, due to its internal programming, as beauty was taken into account in the design, and quality and performance were taken into account when developing it.</p>

  <h4>About program development</h4>
  <p>This application was programmed based on advanced foundations and principles in the world of Flutter programming; Some of the things that contributed greatly to obtaining a standard were taken into account, and these things are:
</p>
  <h5>- The structure used in the application was established based on the principle of Clean Architecture and adherence to the five SOLID principles.</h5>
  <h5>- Using the vector image instead of images that depend on pixels, due to its high quality, small size, and high performance in the application.</h5>
  <h5>- Use the service locator to analyze the space consumed by the RAM and reduce the size of the application.</h5>
  <h5>- Use the Shared preferences plugin and link it to the On Board Screen so that it only appears once.</h5>
  <h5>- Using block state management and separating the ui from the bake</h5>
  <h5>- Responsive design works and is responsive to all screens and different operating systems.</h5>
  <h4>
  There are many things that are considered simple, but they contribute greatly to achieving high performance </h4>
