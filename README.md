  <h4>About program development</h4>
  <p>This application was programmed based on advanced foundations and principles in the world of Flutter programming; Some of the things that contributed greatly to obtaining a standard were taken into account, and these things are:
</p>
  <h5>- The structure used in the application was established based on the principle of Clean Architecture and adherence to the five SOLID principles.</h5>
  <h5>- Using the vector image instead of images that depend on pixels, due to its high quality, small size, and high performance in the application.</h5>
  <h5>- Use the service locator to analyze the space consumed by the RAM and reduce the size of the application.</h5>
  <h5>- Use the Shared preferences plugin and link it to the On Board Screen so that it only appears once.</h5>
  <h5>- Using block state management and separating the ui from the bake</h5>
  <h5>- Responsive design works and is responsive to all screens and different operating systems.</h5>
  <h4>
  There are many things that are considered simple, but they contribute greatly to achieving high performance </h4>
